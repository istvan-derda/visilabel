<h1>Welcome to Visi<b>label</b>!</h1>
Thank you for helping me out!

<h2>What is this about?</h2>
<p>
    I'm currently working on my bachelors-thesis in computer-science with the title "Rating the visibility of digital images with transparencies on plain backgrounds".
    <br/>
    <i>Visi<b>label</b></i> is a tool I built to gather data on what humans perceive as "visible". <br/>
    The data will be used to evaluate my success in implementing an algorithm classifying designs as "Perfectly Visible" or "(Partially) Poorly Visible".

<h2>When are you done?</h2>
<p>
    Technically there is a finite list of designs to rate and it is possible to rate them all. But it is by no means required. You can stop
    anytime and come back later. Your ratings are saved every time you click on "NEXT". Of course more ratings are better :)
